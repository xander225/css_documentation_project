        "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe
        the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML
        dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements
        should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media."

          /* This documentation is not a guide for CSS, else are a few notes of
          things that in my opinion are relevant for learning this language. If
          this is useful for you, well! Also, it should be noted that I am not a
          native English-speaking, so my English could be shit. But well, you
          already are here to learn with me. ðŸ˜Š This project has two very
          special features for me, that when I said it in my mind sounds very
          interesting. The first is that some parts of what you are reading are
          being written with the help of the IA GPT3. And what else is that the
          appearance of this web go to be actualized according to with the
          topics that we will learn as weeks go by. */

        <p>
          In other words, CSS is used to style all HTML tags, including the
          document's body, headings, paragraphs, and other pieces of text. CSS
          can also be used to style the display of table elements, grid
          elements, and images.
        </p>
        <p>
          /* I think that the logic of CSS is essentially easy to understand,
          but the problem with learning this language is like with many other
          topics, the flood of information that should overwhelm us. For this is
          important that we go one step at a time. Divide and rule! The
          information, of course. Or your enemies, or both. As you like. */

        <h2>What do We Need to Learn CSS?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For this, you should know about HTML, at least the basic concepts.
          </li>
          <li>
            A computer. Yeah, you can try it on your mobile whit some app but is
            a little uncomfortable.
          </li>
          <li>
            An IDE. I recommend Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text for the
            start, but you can use the one you want. Only don't use the Notepad,
            that's stupid.
          </li>
          <li>
            A web navigator like Firefox or a navigator based in Chromium like
            Google Chrome or Brave. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Time and patience.
